					A large portion of my memory became filled with false illustrations composed of carefully suppressed experiences. To refer to them as one dimensional is as true as I can be to the role they played. Static, isolated, a reiteration of a falsely constructed language i.e. an opaque barrier, what some might describe as a fog, or perhaps…
					<br>
					<br>
					Clarity became so distant from my mind that it almost made more sense to simply drive myself deeper into the cave I had entered. Protected by the sounds of the wind, positioned close to the edge of this world, dancing as long as I could convince myself that the sun was still shining. As a child I existed in a valley, the rising of the hills alluded to the presence of the great depths of the earth, waiting to swallow us whole. Our descent, inevitably, would serve no purpose but to mark a moment in time now past.
					<br>
					<br>
					Patiently waiting (extracted from the exterior of his own confinement) my movement had been sluggish until I entered this portion of the cave. As I made my way forward my footsteps ceased to make a sound. Perhaps it was the weight, something previously external, that had finally grounded itself. I could feel my heart beat at the point where my boot had constricted the circulation to my foot. It beat softly, finally obeying my desire to become invisible to the approaching landscape. Arriving at the edge of a cliff, his shadows marked the only spaces in which I had the courage to move through. (pay no mind to his image, the boy he once was, forever marked by dissent.) 
					<br>
					<br>
					A large landscape expanded beneath me. Remnants of a monolith, positioned at the center close to the edge of a lake. In the middle, positioned on a small island, lay the man’s dwelling. I had somehow missed it during my descent. A temporary lapse in vision? (external/lacking foresight) On my fifth day I finally gathered the courage to cross the water. It wasn’t that I was afraid of drowning as much it was the uncertainty of what would appear after. I think the main issue was that there would be no one to congratulate me when I made it to the other side. An irrational request, but one that I had been asking since I first arrived, as if a “wish” would be granted as a result of my good will. Entering the body of water was a rather strange experience, I had not been swimming for the past five or six years. There was an unfamiliarity that came with how accommodating the water was for me, it felt rather light as it moved around my feet. However, it was difficult to begin moving. I dove in and attempted to begin swimming but was met by a stiff resistance within my muscles, my right arm rather fatigued from some unknown exertion earlier in my travels. I moved back to shore and began resurveying the surface of the lake. I noticed a group of rocks positioned between myself and the island and decided it would be an appropriate place to rest, or rather, an appropriate point from which I could convince myself to continue moving forward. I had postponed my departure for so long that it seemed reasonable to take my time in crossing. A second entrance, much more graceful than the previous (a sign of growth). I lay on my back, floating along the surface of the water, a slight current pulling me towards the center of the lake.

					The only time I had ever been on the ocean was when I was younger, traveling to Canada from New York to attend a wedding (I think). I spent the majority of the trip positioned at the back of the boat with my sister and father, watching the enormous wake left behind the ferry. There was something odd about the rhythm of the patterns generated in the water. It was timid, I was unprotected. 
					<br>
					<br>
					1) dolphins decapitated by the propellors turning the foam a bright red. at this point the sky would part revealing a slowly diminishing sun. (or perhaps it is late at night and when the clouds break all you are left with is the moon and the million miles that separate two [relatively speaking] groups of moving objects passively observing each other.)
					2) a predisposition to smoking cigarettes, picked up from a man who stood at the opposite end of the boat spending the majority of his time looking out into the ocean.
					3) i must have said something to my sister, because she stopped joining us after the second day.
					<br>
					<br>
					A couple days after arriving we visited the place where my parents had gotten married and, while I can’t seem to recall any specific emotion, it now feels significant. There were paintings in our room, ornamental yet they seemed to continue turning the walls into liquid long after everyone else had fallen asleep.

					In our absence, my body had passed the rocks and reached the shore. The aforementioned ‘dwelling’ in which the ‘man’ resided in was constructed with great care, an attention to detail that I must have found rather amusing because I couldn’t stop smiling. I wasn’t sure whether to knock or simply enter. I was under the impression that he would be aware of my arrival (and I was a bit worried that attempting to be courteous would reveal itself to be an empty gesture). Thankfully before I had a chance to regret either decision he stepped outside and a conversation progressed as follows:
					<br>
					<br>
					“You’re here earlier than I expected.” he said.
					<br>
					“I found no where else to go.”
					<br>
					“Are you hoping to achieve something?”
					<br>
					“I would like to think I’m past that.” I had to breath for a moment and he waited patiently for me to begin again. “Yes,” perhaps this answer contained more honesty, “but I don’t think I’ve ever been too sure of what it may be.” (We’ve travelled here before, together I mean, so it seems logical to search elsewhere.) “Where do you look?”
					<br>
					“Through God.” he replied quickly.
					<br>
					“Within what?”
					<br>
					“Even metaphorically speaking it is hard to talk about it as a tangible, or tactile experience.”
					<br>
					“Yet you seem to avoid speaking in abstractions”
					<br>
					“There has always been enough room to speculate within the concrete.”
					<br>
					“And where do you think I am?” I had become angry at this point. There was no wall to bang my head against so I resolved to let my feet sink further into the sand as blood began to drip from my nose. “You’ve never left this island.” It had come out as a whisper.
					<br>
					“I can no longer walk on water, and I’m afraid I don’t know how to swim.” he was still calm which agitated me even more.
					<br>
					<br>
					He finsaly admitted that he was only human. I made my way along the shore till I found an adequately sized rock, tied it to my foot, and began to enter the water.
					<br>
					<br>

					<br>
					<br>
					Together we shall enter a period of speculation but first, excuse me for a moment, my eyes have become clouded. Perhaps this is more easily illustrated as a thin film, frosted glass? (an opaque barrier, what some might describe as a fog, or perhaps…) Yet, beyond each of these screens, I always seem to find the same thing: 
					<br>
					<br>
					What is described as - “An endless void: In the center, a circular path, ever expanding. A fixed point ( ) defined as the window from which I first entered. While seemingly endless (implying a singular direction)… ‘I’ve noticed my movement becoming recursive.’ (This statement may prove to be too concrete) Yet I would force myself continue moving ‘Forward’ (generally speaking).”
					<br>
					<br>
					A summer two years later will mark another period of transition. While as banal as most of the others, we can assume it’s significant based on a series of externally validated points. A year prior, what I will now refer to as the present (an assumption), can act as the counterpoint or, in a way, as the antithesis:
