					Assumption: Branding exists to distill concept down to its visual essence.
					<br>
					<br>
					The introduction of digital realities (e.g. the internet) into to day to day life has significantly altered our methods for interfacing with the world we live in. Graphic design can function to bridge the gap between the digital and physical world but has, for the most part, modeled digital spaces based on parameters informed by our physical reality. The essence of a concept, as it should exist in digital space, is lost in the limitations of physical space.
					<br>
					<br>
					Given this observation, I believe the most appropriate movement forward is to begin experimenting with / developing systems that bridge the gap between the physical and digital world, replacing a part of the process of physical translation to one of pure data calculated through formless algorithms. What I am hoping to achieve is a graphic system that aids in the construction of visual form by replacing the designer in certain parts of the process for the sake of clarification. The system will be automated (some sort of rule set applied using python / java or another programming language) and will be run iteratively, having the capacity to learn and adapt on its own. This process will allow the system to both mimic and inform the designers actions.
